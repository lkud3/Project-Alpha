# Project-Alpha
Java project with the console menu implementation
This work is the part of the final project of college class CS 105: Introduction To Programming I. The code itself represents the 7-option menu that runs until the user decides to exit and enter the 7th option. Each of the sixth other options perform different calculations and mini-tasks that develop a deeper understanding of the coding on Java. The options to choose from and functions to call are: Prime Integer Detection, Statistics of exact power of 4, Text to morse converter, The statistics of sorted integers method, Palindrome detector, Amicable numbers detector. There is an additional option to choose that tells more about the logic of each option. 

Attached could be found the project report with additional explanations and snapshots of the work of the program.
